**A simple VLC music player in Python with TKinter GUI**

This is a school project.
Comments are full in english but don't expect fixes or answered on issues!
There is a Win version the main version is for Linux (I use arch btw)


Knowen bugs i am to lazzy to fix:
    -If you press Stop -> everythin other then play | it will only load song 1 (i know the fix(deactivate the other buttons but to lazzy :3))

    -If you spam it breaks or doesnt seems random 

    -After a song ends the player doesnt go to the next song... what should i say i know but dont know a solution

    -Loading more then ones breaks the list at the side of the GUI (same as Problem one i am to lazzy)

You hate the colors?! Yeah me too.
If you want to change them just go to the bottem of the skript and change them.
Just replace the hex codes!
You can use https://coolors.co/palettes for inspo.

Will I fix the issues or will make progress on the skript?
    No its a school project. If I find time sure but no.
    You can do as you please with the skript.

Thanks that VLC has a pip package for some reason but gezz THANKS! Wouldn't be able to do this so easy without

For my faild attempts look at the dead / test repo : https://github.com/AquaFrostByte/Tkinter
